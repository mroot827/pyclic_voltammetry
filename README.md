# pyclic_voltammetry
Pyclic Voltammetry is a simple tool for calling peaks and measuring basic electrochemical parameters [reduction/oxidation potential, half-wave potential, peak-to-peak separation, peak ratio] from cyclic voltammograms. 

**[IUPAC convention only]**

Accepted file inputs are .txt files and results are displayed on a cyclic voltammogram and output into a dataframe.
